# BigAndSmall
Adds a whole bunch of Biotech Genes and Traits related to size along with Races based around said traits.

Put this mod high up in the mod load order. Consider disabling texture caching in Vanilla Framework Expanded if your pawns get cropped when zoomed out.

[H1]Main Features[/H1]

• New Genes, mostly related to pawn size.
• New Traits for smaller size variations
• New Xenohumans
• 2 Optional Factions

[h1]Traits and Genes[/h1]

The Mod also adds a number of new genes for you to harvest. I've tried to keep things balanced, so it hopefully shouldn't be any more broken than vanilla gene editing already is.
Three of the genes are archotech genes, two of which are held by the Fire and Frost Jotun respectively.

A number of size-related traits, these act like small to moderate multipliers for a pawn's size. They also have associated genes which can be found in traders inventories. The traits are "Dwarfism", "Small", "Large", and "Gigantism". The bottom center three pawns on the line up is one Pawn with Dwarfism, next to an average-size pawn, and a pawn with Gigantism on the other side.

Finally the mod adds a few statDefs (bodySizeModifier, bodySizeMultiplier), the former acts as an offset, and the latter acts as a multiplier to a pawns size. The size increase from these two parameters has special effects on pawns, increasing their health, hunger, melee damage, among other things. I've generally set things up for the purpose of good gameplay rather than realism.

[H1]Xenohumans[/H1]

[H2]Ogres[/H2]
[i]They are lumbering large bone-headed creatures creatures primarily motivated by fighting and food. Rumor has it some of them are amazing cooks; shame they prefer cooking other humanoids. A some ogres are particularly large and bad temperered.[/i]

While troublesome Ogres can be a powerful asset to a colony, their size makes them competent haulers and miners. They are also surprisingly good cooks. Just don't ask where they found all that pork.

[H2]Jotun [/H2]
[i]They are fairly elusive giants known to hide up in the mountains. Some have an extreme temperature tolerance, and some claim they were created as a workforce.[/i]

Jotun are often found hiding away in some mountain, sometimes with a number of slaves from smaller races. While they think themselves above the smaller races they are in fact rather slow on the intellectual uptake.

Fire Jotun and Frost Jotun are virtually immune to their respective elements. Half Jotun are much smaller than proper Jotun, but much smarter than their larger ancestors.

[H2]Dvergr [/H2]
[i]They are small elusive bearded people often seeked out for their craftsmanship which is said to be on par with that of the best glittertech factories. Some claim they were created to act as mechanics on spaceships where their small size was advantageous.[/i]

Dvergr are asocial, rarely living with more than maybe a sibling or parent. Most would prefer to simply hide away in a hole with some mead crafting away. Unfortunately they are rather poor farmers, so they often find themselves forced to deal with other races to get said alcohol.

While the Dvergr are prone to fits of violence the main reason such threats should be taken seriously is because they tend to have armor and weapon of outstanding quality.

[H2]Nisse[/H2]
[i]They are sometimes claimed to have been created for similar purposes to the Dverger, but their unremarkable affinity for machines and impressive rapport with animals indicate otherwise.[/i]

They don't particularly like company besides animals, but they rather struggle both weathering the elements and building homes of their own, which often leads them to retreat to the settlements of other races.

Nisse possess an unbelievable intuitive understanding for both how to handle plants and animals, and have been known to call wild animals to their defense. If displeased for any reason, and they are rather easy to displease, they have been known to be very very vengeful.

[H1]Issues[/H1]

This mod is in early development, and while I have not found any bugs in this version it is like everything else at your own risk. Some traits, factions, genes, reuse vanilla icons, the factions aren't quite fleshed out yet, and some descriptions might be incomp

[list]
[*] I'm aware of a mod conflict/mod order issue that can cause hair to render at the wrong size. I'm not yet sure what mod causes the issue. You can easily resolve it by putting this mod near the top of your modlist.
[*] If character sprites appear cropped when zoomed out, try to disable texture caching in Vanilla Framework Expanded. Thanks Camille_KMS 
[*] Minor issue with Vanilla Framework Expanded, but when facing West in the Character Editor (mod) the body orientation will be incorrect. The same issue also happens for some sleeping poses when using beds that render the pawn's full body.
[/list]

[H1]Plans for the future[/H1]

• Polishing up on features, creating icons, more balancing improvements, etc.
• I'd also like to add some settings to the mod. You can of course use the Cherry Picker Mod to pick and choose what to use, but settings for stuff like hunger scaling, damage scaling (linear at the moment, could be made quadratic if you really want to die to ogres with wooden clubs...), etc.

[H1]Recommended mods[/H1]
Any of the major head mods. The head can come out the wrong size otherwise. Make sure this loads before the head mod.

A mod that fixes gene inheritance makes sure xenotype children get their parents genes. F.ex. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2881479142
